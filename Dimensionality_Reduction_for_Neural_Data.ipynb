    "One of the reasons for the enduring popularity of PCA is its analytical interpretability. To demonstrate this, we will present two mathematically equivalent formulations of PCA: 1) identifying the directions of maximum projected variance, and 2) finding the best low-dimensional approximation to the data matrix. By setting up these two questions as constrained optimization problems (following [2]), it can be shown that the two formulations yield the same solution: the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix. We will then cover the relationship between PCA and singular value decomposition (SVD), and the Eckart-Young Theorem which guarantees that the SVD is the closest low-rank approximation to the data matrix. The equivalence of these two formulations (the closest low rank approximation and vs directions of maximum variance) will set up the intuition necessary to understand data tensor extensions such as TCA or sliceTCA."

    "When discussing PCA, we follow convention that we are working with a data matrix $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times K}$ where $N$ is the number of neurons and $K$ the number of samples. We further assume that the data has already been centered, that is the activity of each neuron has been subtracted its mean. The sample covariance matrix $\\mathbf{\\hat\\Sigma}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}$ is then defined as $\\mathbf{\\hat \\Sigma} = \\frac{1}{N_\\text{samples}}\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{X}^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by seeking the vector $\\mathbf{u} \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ that maximizes the variance of the projected data. We further add the constraint that $\\bf u$ must be normalized ($\\mathbf{u}^T\\mathbf{u}=1$, else the problem is unbounded). Then, the projected data is simply $\\mathbf{u}^T\\mathbf{X}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{K}$. The projected variance is then given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\text{var}(\\mathbf{u}^T\\mathbf{X}) =& \\frac{1}{N_\\text{samples}}(\\mathbf{u}^T \\mathbf{X})(\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{u}) \\\\\n",

    "=& \\mathbf{u}^T \\mathbf{\\hat \\Sigma} \\mathbf{u}.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to solve such an optimization problem is to use [Lagrange multipliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multiplier). First, we define the Lagrange function:\n",

    "\n",
    "That is, $ \\mathbf{\\hat \\Sigma u} = \\lambda \\mathbf{u}$, therefore  $\\mathbf{u}$ must be an eigenvector of the data covariance matrix and $\\lambda$ its corresponding eigenvalue.

Therefore the vector that maximizes the projected variance is the eigenvector of $\\bf \\hat \\Sigma$ with the largest eigenvalue.\n",

    "### PCA as the low-dimensional projection that minimizes reconstruction error\n",
    "\n",
    "In this second formulation we will attempt to find the low-dimensional projection of $\\mathbf{X}$ with the smallest *reconstruction error*. We'll denote each sample (i.e. column) of the data matrix as ${\\bf x}_n\\in\\mathbb{R}^N$. We thus seek an $R$-dimensional subspace such that, on average over all samples, the data projected on this subspace $\\mathbf{\\hat x}_n\\in\\mathbb{R}^N$ is closest to ${\\bf x}_n$. We'll call our candidate orthonormal basis $\\mathbf{u}_1,\\dots,\\mathbf{u}_R\\in\\mathbb{R}^N$, which spans this $R$-dimensional subspace within the $N$-dimensional activity space. Then, the estimate of each sample can be written as the linear combination:\n",
    "\n",
    "$${\\bf \\hat x}_n =\\sum_{i=1}^R \\beta_{ni} \\mathbf{u}_i$$\n",

    "Note that we're still missing $N-R$ vectors needed to form a complete orthonormal basis for the full activity space: we'll simply call such vectors $\\mathbf{u}_{R+1},\\dots,\\mathbf{u}_N$. This means that we can rewrite each sample as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$${\\bf x}_n =\\sum_{i=1}^N \\alpha_{ni} \\mathbf{u}_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the $\\mathbf{u}_i$'s are orthonormal, the coefficients are simply given by the projections of the data onto each basis vector: $\\alpha_{ni} =\\mathbf{x}_n^T \\mathbf{u}_{i} $. You can verify this by taking the dot product of the above equation with $\\mathbf{u}_j$ (remembering that $\\mathbf{u}_i$'s being orthonormal is defined as: $\\mathbf{u}_i\\cdot \\mathbf{u}_j=1$ if $i=j$ else $0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write the mean-squared error as:\n",
    "$$ E =  \\frac{1}{N \\cdot N_\\text{samples}} \\sum_{n=1}^{N_\\text{samples}} \\lVert \\mathbf{x}_n - \\mathbf{\\hat x}_n \\rVert^2 $$\n",
    "First, using our expressions for the samples above, we can write the residual on the right as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, noting that $\\lVert \\mathbf{x}_n - \\mathbf{\\hat x}_n \\rVert^2 = ( \\mathbf{x}_n - \\mathbf{\\hat x}_n )\\cdot  (\\mathbf{x}_n - \\mathbf{\\hat x}_n)$, and using the fact that the $\\mathbf{u}_i$'s are orthonormal, the norm of the residual can be simplified as:\n",

    "$$\\frac{d E}{d \\beta_{ni}} =  \\frac{2}{N \\cdot N_\\text{samples}} (\\beta_{ni} - \\alpha_{ni})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which means that the $\\beta_{ni}$ that minimizes the MSE is given simply by $\\beta_{ni} = \\alpha_{ni} = \\mathbf{x}_n^T \\mathbf{u}_i$.

    "=& \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=R+1}^N \\mathbf{u}_j^T \\mathbf{\\hat \\Sigma u}_j\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Where last step follows from $\\mathbf{x}_n$ being mean-centered. It now remains to find an orthonormal basis $\\mathbf{u}_j$ that minimizes the mean squared error. In the case that $R=N-1$, we have the same Lagrangian as before (up to a scaling factor):\n",

    "### PCA as a low-rank approximation to the data matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we saw PCA as solving two different constrained optimization problems by projecting of the data onto the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. Further, since the covariance matrix has an orthonormal set of eigenvectors, this projection can be considered as a change of basis from Cartesian coordinates (i.e., each dimension represents a different neuron) to a more \"natural\" basis of the data (i.e., each dimension represents a different covariability pattern across the population). Mathematically this projection is given by the equation:\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{Z} = \\mathbf{U}^T \\mathbf{X}$$\n",
    "where $\\bf U \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times N}$ is a matrix whose columns are given by the orthonormal eigenvectors of $\\mathbf{\\hat \\Sigma}$, in order of descending eigenvalue magnitude (which is the variance of the projected data, therefore this ranks the components by how much variance of the data they capture).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that since its columns $\\mathbf{u}_i$ are orthonormal, $\\bf U$ is a unitary matrix. An important property of unitary matrices is that $\\mathbf{U}^{-1} = \\mathbf{U}^T$. To see this, note that the $\\mathbf{U}^T \\mathbf{U} = \\mathbf{I}$ falls out naturally from matrix multiplication, as $(\\mathbf{U}^T \\mathbf{U})_{ij}=\\mathbf{u}_i^T\\mathbf{u}_j = \\delta_{ij}$ by orthonormality. To prove that $ \\mathbf{U} \\mathbf{U}^T = \\mathbf{I}$, we can multiply both sides of the equation above by $\\mathbf{U}$ on the left and $\\mathbf{U}^{-1}$ on the right as follows:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\mathbf{U}^T \\mathbf{U} &= \\mathbf{I} \\\\\n",
    "\\mathbf{U}(\\mathbf{U}^T \\mathbf{U})\\mathbf{U}^{-1} &= \\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{U}^{-1}\\\\\n",
    "\\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{U}^T &= \\mathbf{I} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "This is important in the context of PCA because it means we can easily move $\\mathbf{U}$ to the other side of the equation to project the scores back into the original basis, returning the original data matrix:\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{U} \\mathbf{Z} = \\mathbf{X}$$\n",
    "and now we see that PCA is a *matrix decomposition*, meaning that it decomposes the data matrix into a product of two matrices: the new basis vectors (or loadings) $\\bf U$ and the projected data (or scores) $\\mathbf Z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In dimensionality reduction, the purpose is to reduce the number of features used to capture the data. In PCA, this is done by taking the first $R$ components, which correspond to the largest eigenvalues (and thus the directions of largest projected variance). To do this we simply truncate the projection matrix after the first $R$ columns to get $\\mathbf{ U }_{R}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times R}$. Then the $R$-dimensional scores are still given by the same formula:\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{Z}_R = \\mathbf{U}_{R}^T \\mathbf{X}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However we cannot simply move $\\mathbf{U}_{R}$ to the other side of the equation. While we still have $\\mathbf{U}_{R}^T  \\mathbf{U}_{R} = \\mathbf{I}$ (due to orthonormality of the columns), we can no longer guarantee that $ \\mathbf{U}_{R} \\mathbf{U}_{R}^T  = \\mathbf{I}$ since our proof above relied on the existence of $\\mathbf{U}_{R}^{-1}$, which does not exist for non-square matrices ($R< N$)! Geometrically, this makes sense since we can project from a high-dimensional space to a low-dimensional space but cannot invert the projection to recover the exact original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can try to revert the transformation anyway by projecting the top $R$ components back into the $N$-dimensional space using $\\mathbf{U}_R$. This results in the following *approximation* to the data matrix:\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{ \\hat X} = \\mathbf{U}_{R} \\mathbf{Z}_R$$\n",
    "Another way to write this approxmination is to expand it as a sum of the outer products of the column.\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{ \\hat X} = \\sum_{r=1}^R \\mathbf{u}_{r} \\mathbf{ z}^T_r$$\n",
    "where $ \\mathbf{u}_{r}$ are the columns of $ \\mathbf{U}$ and $ \\mathbf{ z}^T_r$ are the rows of $\\mathbf{Z}$. Each column of $\\mathbf{\\hat X}$ is a linear combination of the $R$ basis vectors, so the rank of $ \\mathbf{ \\hat X} $ is (at most) $R$. Equivalently, the approximated data will lie on an $R$-dimensional subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^N$ spanned by the new basis $\\mathbf{u}_1,\\dots,\\mathbf{u}_R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us back to the low-dimensional projection view that we saw previously, which further suggests that it may be the best low-rank approximation of the data matrix. This is indeed the case, as we will see in the next section.\n"

    "### Relationship between PCA and SVD\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is very closely related to a more general matrix decomposition called the singular value decomposition (SVD). It is an amazing fact that any rank-$R$ matrix can be decomposed into three matrices:\n",
    "$$ {\\mathbf X} = {\\mathbf U S} \\mathbf{V}^T$$\n",
    "where ${\\mathbf U} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times R}$ and $\\mathbf{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K \\times R}$ have orthonormal columns (called the left and right singular vectors, respectively) that define new rotated bases for their respective vector spaces, and $\\mathbf{S}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{R \\times R}$ is a positive diagonal matrix (whose diagonal elements $\\sigma_i$ are called the singular values, and are ranked in decreasing order). Most often, you will equivalently find it defined with, $U\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times \\min\\{N,K\\}}$, $S\\in\\mathbb{R}^{\\min \\{N,K\\}\\times \\min\\{N,K\\}}$, $V\\in\\mathbb{R}^{\\min\\{N,K\\}\\times N}$, in which case the rank of $\\bf X$ is simply the number of non-zero singular values. The SVD can be thought of as decomposing a matrix into how it operates on vectors: by taking a $K$-dimensional vector, rotating it into a new basis, shrinking or stretching the new coordinates according to $\\sigma_i$, and projecting it into $\\mathbb{R}^N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this relate to PCA? To see this, let's again assume that $\\mathbf{X}$ is mean-centered and calculate the covariance matrix using the SVD:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\mathbf{\\hat \\Sigma} =& \\frac{1}{N_\\text{samples}}\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{X}^T \\\\\n",
    "=& \\frac{1}{N_\\text{samples}}\\mathbf{USV}^T\\mathbf{VSU}^T \\\\\n",
    "=& \\frac{1}{N_\\text{samples}}\\mathbf{US}^2\\mathbf{U}^T \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "which is an eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix (up to the scaling). Therefore the transformed basis vectors ${\\mathbf U}$ in SVD and PCA are identical, and the eigenvalues and singular values are related as $\\lambda_i = \\sigma_i^2/N_\\text{samples}$. Consistent with the previous definitions, the scores in PCA are given by $\\mathbf{Z=U}^T\\mathbf{X=U}^T\\mathbf{USV}^T=\\mathbf{SV}^T$. Therefore, in the language of SVD, dimensionality reduction with PCA is equivalent to truncating the decomposition after $R$ singular values. This means taking only the first $R$ columns of ${\\mathbf U}$ and ${\\mathbf V}$ as well as the upper $R\\times R$ corner of $\\mathbf S$ to get the following rank-$R$ approximation:\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{\\hat X} = \\mathbf {U}_R \\mathbf{S}_{R} \\mathbf{V}_R^T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, the [Eckart-Young Theorem](https://rich-d-wilkinson.github.io/MATH3030/3-5-lowrank.html) states that the truncated SVD approximation above gives the rank-$R$ that is closest to the data matrix in the Frobenius norm:\n",
    "$$\\min_{\\text{rank}(\\mathbf{Y}) \\leq R} \\lVert  \\mathbf{X - Y} \\rVert_F$$\n",
    "with $\\lVert  \\mathbf{X - \\hat X} \\rVert_F = \\left(\\sum_{i=R+1}^N \\sigma_i^2\\right)^\\frac{1}{2}$. Equivalently, this means that taking the top $R$ principal components PCA results in the best low-rank approximation to the data with the following MSE:\n",
    "$$E = \\frac{1}{N \\cdot N_\\text{samples}}\\sum_{i=R+1}^{N}\\sigma_i^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Together with the maths demonstrated above, this shows that there is a deep connection between minimizing the error of a low rank (or low-dimensional) approximation and capturing covariability patterns in neural data.

This is in general ill-defined since we are moving from a low-dimensional subspace to a high-dimensional space, but the key idea is to use the *training* neurons in the *test* samples, in addition to the low-dimensional basis we just identified from the *training* samples, to predict the *test* neuron's activity in the *test* samples. Starting from the equivalent block formula for the test samples, we have:\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{X}^{te}_{tr} \\\\ \\mathbf{X}_{te}^{te} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{U}_{R,tr} \\\\ \\mathbf{U}_{R,te} \\end{bmatrix} \\mathbf{Z}_{R}^{te}$$\n",

    "$$\\mathbf{\\hat X}^{te}_{te} = \\mathbf{U}_{R,te}\\mathbf{\\hat Z}_{R}^{te}$$\n",
    "We can now calculate the fraction of explained variance in the estimate as we [normally would](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_of_variance_unexplained#:~:text=In%20statistics%2C%20the%20fraction%20of,by%20the%20explanatory%20variables%20X.):\n",

    "There are a couple practicalities to note from this method that stem from the linear regression problem. First, note that the number of neurons in the training set has to be greater than $R$, or else the linear regression problem is underdetermined. This puts a limit to what dimensionalities we can test depending on how many neurons we can afford to use for training. Second, since we are using a subset of neurons to predict activity in other neurons, this method does not work well if the test neurons are independent of the training neurons. In other words it assumes some amount of shared variability between the neurons.\n",

    "\n",
    "To cross-validate other methods, we can simply hold out or mask entries of the data matrix/tensor while fitting the parameters of the model (e.g. the $\\mathbf{u}$'s) on the remaining entries [4]. However, we must be careful to take into account temporal correlations since the tensor entries are not independently generated. That is, if we hold out single entries randomly throughout the matrix, the training and testing dataset will be strongly correlated. In fact, assuming the data is continuous in time (as would be the case for imaging data, or with firing rate estimates), with a sufficiently high sampling rate (i.e. sufficiently small time bins), the entry $\\mathcal{X}_{i,j,k}$ of the data tensor (supposed to be in the test set) can be arbitrarily well approximated by averaging the $\\mathcal{X}_{i,j-1,k}$ and $\\mathcal{X}_{i,j+1,k}$ (which may both be in the train set). Instead, we advocate for holding out blocks and trimming the ends for the most fair separation between test and training data [5]. What timescale should we use? Some good bets are the timescale of the calcium indicator (imaging data) the smoothing kernel (for ephys). Or we can simply use the autocorrelation timescale for any arbitrary time series.\n",
